## About

Get Git Url (GGU) is a Sublime-Text plugin that generate Github URL of the file you are on, from your editor and paste it to clipboard.

## Usage

I want my editor to quickly generate the Github URL for the file I am workfing on without jumping to the browser to   
search for the file and line of the code and paste the URL to share it.

So I made this.
